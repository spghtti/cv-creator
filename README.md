# CV Creator App

## About this project

Create a modern CV right in your browser. Click the buttons to add your photo, education, work experience and relevant skills. To add your personal info, simply click each section to edit.

This is a solution to the Odin's Project's [assignment](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/javascript/lessons/cv-application) to build a React app entirely using React class components (i.e. no functional components).
